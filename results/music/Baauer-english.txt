Baauer grew up in several countries, because of his father's work. He lived in Germany from age four to seven, London, United Kingdom from seven to thirteen, then returned to the United States, where he lived in Westport, Connecticut from 13â€“17.

Baauer's single "Harlem Shake" was released on Mad Decent/Jeffrees on May 22, 2012. The track received critical acclaim with Pitchfork claiming "it's hard not to marvel at how awesome those growling-lion samples sound". "Harlem Shake" created a viral video craze online, inspiring fans to upload their own videos for the hit from February 2013 onwards, often featuring those involved remaining still for the first buildup of the song, and dancing erratically or humorously afterwards.
Baauer collaborated with hip hop producer Just Blaze on the track "Higher". Both producers toured together throughout January and February 2013.

Disclosure are an English electronic music duo, consisting of brothers Guy (born 11 May 1994) and Howard Lawrence (born 25 May 1991). The siblings grew up in Reigate, Surrey. Their debut album Settle, released on 3 June 2013 through PMR, was nominated for Best Dance/Electronica Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards.


The duo's first single "Offline Dexterity" on 29 August 2010 was followed by another "Carnival"/"I Love...That You Know" on 13 June 2011.
Disclosure picked up their first significant national radio support upon the release of the "Tenderly"/"Flow" single in January 2012. The single led to significant interest in the subsequent June 2012 EP The Face, released on Greco-Roman. The EP included the popular remix of "Running" by Jessie Ware, which charted in both the Netherlands and Belgium as well as becoming a fixture of the 2012 Festival Circuit and featuring on the annual edition of Annie Mac presents.
The duo had their first UK hit in October 2012, with "Latch" (with the vocals from Sam Smith) which peaked at number 11 in the UK Singles Chart. The group maintained their momentum into 2013 - they were voted into the BBC Radio 1xtra 'Hot Ten For 2013' and scored two consecutive top 10 hit singles in "White Noise" (#2) (with AlunaGeorge) and "You & Me" (#10) (with Eliza Doolittle). These three singles were collected on an EP, The Singles. They released their full debut album, Settle, on PMR Records on 3 June 2013 and was met with commercial and critical success, debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, charting in many countries across Europe and Australia, and receiving four stars from the Guardian and a 9.1 score on Pitchfork. They performed twice at Glastonbury Festival 2013 and appeared on Laterâ€¦ with Jools Holland. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Album.
In 2013, Disclosure embarked on a worldwide tour of more than 40 European, American, and Canadian cities including high-profile music festivals such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Lollapalooza Music Festival in Chicago, and Sasquatch Festival in Washington State. The same year they established the record label Method Records; its roster includes Friend Within, Karen Harding, Lxury, and Tourist.
